# Medical Data Visualizer

A Python-based data analysis project that visualizes and analyzes medical examination data to explore relationships between cardiovascular disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 70,000+ medical examination records to identify correlations between various health metrics and the presence of cardiovascular disease. Using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the project provides insights into how lifestyle factors and body measurements relate to cardiac health outcomes.

## 🎯 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes medical examination data
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculates BMI and creates overweight classification
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Categorical plots comparing health outcomes for cardiac vs. non-cardiac patients
  - Correlation heatmaps showing relationships between all health metrics
- **Outlier Detection**: Filters invalid data points in blood pressure, height, and weight measurements

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
